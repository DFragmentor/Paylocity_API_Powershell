# Paylocity_API_Powershell
PowerShell to connect to and utilize the Paylocity API

I created this documentation to help admins utilize the Paylocity API with PowerShell. You can use this infomration to build automations based on infomration within Paylocity.

You will need to work with HR/Paylocity to gain a ClientID, Client Seceret and a Paylocity Public Key.
